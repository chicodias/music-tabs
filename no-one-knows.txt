We get some rules to follow

No one knows

We get these pills to swallow
Cm                         G B
How they stick in your throat

I journey through the desert
Cm                     G B
Of the mind with no hope

I drift along the ocean
Cm                    G B
Dead lifeboat in the sun
B          Cm Riff1
And come undone
G                   B
Pleasantly caving in
           Cm Riff 1
I come undone

Heaven smiles above me

What a gift here below

No one knows
