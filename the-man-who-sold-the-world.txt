David Bowie - The Man Who Sold The World

[Intro]  A  Dm  F  Dm
                      A
We passed upon the stair
     A7               Dm
We spoke of was and when
                    A
Although i wasn't there
    A7               F
He said i was his friend
                        C
Which came as some surprise
    C7           A
I spoke into his eyes
               A7    Dm
I thought you died alone

                   C
A long long time ago


    C       F                         
Oh no! not me,            
    C#             F             
We never lost control              
        C       F            
You're face to face                                                                                                           
          C#
With the man who sold the world  
              
( A  Dm  F  Dm )
                         A
I laughed and shook his hand
   A7               Dm
I made my way back home
                         A
I searched for form and land
    A7                 F
For years and years i roamed
                   C
I gazed a gazely stare
   C7                A   
At all the millions here
              A7    Dm
We must have died alone

                   C
A long long time ago


      C         F
Who knows, not me
    C#             F
We never lost control
        C        F
You're face, to face
          C#
With the man who sold the world

( A  Dm  F  Dm )
