Tom Jobim - Quiet Nights (Corcovado)

Am6                             G#º(b13)
   Quiet nights of quiet stars

Quiet chords from my guitar
Gm7             C7/4(9)            F7M      F6
Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Fm7                   Bb7/9         E7(13)
   Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams
      E7(b13)  A7/4(9)     A7(b9) Am6
Quiet walks by quiet streams
                            Bb7(9)
And a window looking on the mountains

And the sea, so lovely
Am6                            G#º(b13)
   This is where I want to be

Here, with you so close to me
  Gm7           C7/4(9)           F°   F6
Until the final flicker of life's amber
Fm7                   Bb7/9    Em7
   I who was lost and lonely
                   Am7   Dm7
Believing life was only
                G7/4(9)
A bitter tragic joke
G7(b9)           E7(#9)    A7(b9/b13)   Dm7
Have found with you
                G7/4(9    G#°      Am6
The meaning of existence,    oh my love!
