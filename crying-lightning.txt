Arctic Monkeys - Crying Lightning

[Intro] Am  F  Am  E
        Am  G  C  E

 Am            F           Am           E
Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
            Am         G      C    G#
You were practicing a magic trick
         Am          F            Am          E
And my thoughts got rude, as you talked and chewed
        Am           G        C     E
On the last of your Pick and Mix

                                 Am             F
Said you're mistaken if you're thinking that I haven't been caught
 Am           E
cold before
       Am               G          C     E
As you bit into your Strawberry Lace
                           Am             F         Am          E
And then a flip in your attention in the form of a Gobstopper
                Am              G         C      E
Is all you had left and it was going to waste

( Am )

Your pastime's consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called
Crying lightning
And how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons

( Am )

                      Am               F
The next time that I caught my own reflection
       Am              E
It was on its way to meet you
Am             G        C        E
Thinking of excuses to postpone
                     Am                F
You never look like yourself from the side
          Am                E
But your profile could not hide
             Am             G         C          E
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne

            Am            F                   Am
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
E                       Am                G            C     E
Stood and puffed your chest out like you never lost a war
              Am              F           Am             E
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
      Am                 G              C       E
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

       F               Dm
And your pastime's consisted of the strange
     Am
And twisted and deranged
      Am                                 F
And I hate that little game you have called
        Dm
Crying lightning
                    Am
And how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
F     Dm
 Uninviting
    Am
But not half as impossible as everyone assumes
        F       Dm
You Are Crying lightning
