Coloured old grey whistle test lights

Cute new places keep on popping up
          Fmaj7            G             Em
Since the exodus it's all getting gentrified
                 Am                  Fmaj7
I put a taqueria on the roof it was well reviewed

Four stars out of five  and thats unheard of

The hero of special effects in my mind's eye
Am
Hokey cokey with the opposite sex

The things you try to forget
         F

Around Clavius it's all getting gentrified
                        Am            Fmaj7
The information action ratio is the place to go
         G             Em  Am    Fmaj7        G
And you will not recognise   the old headquarters

At the information action ratio
C#m                                       C#dim7
Only time that we stop laughing is to breathe or steal a kiss
       B              Cdim7             C#m  C#madd6
I can get you on the list for all the clubs
       B            Cdim7      C#m  C#madd6
I can lift you up another semitone
